## About Cyber Break
Cyber Break is a partnership between CyberSafeIreland and Permanent TSB Community Fund, a day where families agree to take a break from online.
This quiz app is an accompaniment to Cyber Break for families to answer questions in a fun quiz format on their online safety habits and knowledge, and get a basic response to let them know how they're doing in that regard.
